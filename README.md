# My Personal Project

## Farm Management system for farm of animals

A virtual *manageable farm* system:

- This application will allow users to create animals <br> from a list of available animals
- Each animal will have unique features and belong to a specified category of type, and <br> require special care
- User can feed the animals, to ensure they are cared for
- Animals will either grow or die depending on the <br> **conditions created and managed by the user**

The purpose of this project is to create a fun and engaging animal management system. And allow the user to be engaged
in
caring for the animals created and nurtured by the User.

## User Stories

*Phase 1*:<br>
In the context of my animal farm management system:<br>
Users can create animals and name them.
Animals will start to weaken immediately after being created and have a starting health of 100.
Users can add animals to a pen or area which will have a slower decay rate, but still decay.
Users can feed animals to keep them alive by choosing the animal they want to feed.

Advanced:
Users can create animals from a list of available animals displayed to the user<br>
in the UI. Then the user can place the animal in several pens or areas that have different characteristics <br>
Such as, temperature, rain exposure, bug exposure, rain exposure.<br>
The user will have to decide which environment will best fit the animal type. <br>
The animals will either start dying or grow based on the conditions.

To create the animal, I will code the classes in Java to give their unique characteristics. <br>
And the animals will be placed in several pens. These will be list <Animal> and <br> also have altering
characteristics <br>
that affect the livability of each animal, based on their type and individual characteristics.

Animals can level up

Extra

- if animal dies in farm, you lose points
- animals level up depending on amount of time above 50 health.
- as animals level up you gain points, which can increase your farm size

*Phase 2*:<br>
As a user, I want the option to save my animals and farm into a file. I will have the option to save the state of it.
As a user I want to have the option to load the state of my game, the level of each animal and size of farm.
